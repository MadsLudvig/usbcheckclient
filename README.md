### TODO

Can be done now:
- [ ] Draw board in EAGLE
- [ ] Search on the internet for how to configure Serial-usb chip and update schematic
- [ ] Make flowchart for python script

Breadboarding needed first:
- [ ] Figure out what the serial address is in window
- [ ] Update flowchart with correct serial address

Nicks advice needed first:
- [ ] Check that schematic in EAGLE is correct
- [ ] Ask if EAGLE board is correct
